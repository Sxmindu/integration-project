If any Matter is not resolved, as set forth above, the parties then agree that it shall be resolved by binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS through its Los Angeles, California office, in accordance with California law. Any such arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator, who shall also be a retired judge of a state or federal court, experienced in entertainment disputes, and selected from the JAMS panel of arbitrators proffered by its Los Angeles, California office. If the parties cannot agree upon an arbitrator after good faith discussion, the arbitrator shall be chosen by JAMS pursuant to the requirements of this paragraph. The parties agree that the arbitrator's ruling in the arbitration shall be final and binding and not subject to appeal or challenge: The parties further agree that the arbitration proceedings, testimony, discovery and documents filed in the course of such proceedings, including the fact that the arbitration is being conducted, must be treated as confidential and must not be disclosed to any third party to such proceedings, except the arbitrator(s) and their staff. the parties attorneys and their staff, and any experts retained by the parties, provided that such arbitrator(s) and their staff, the JAMS and its staff, the parties' attorneys and their staff, and any experts retained by the parties. The Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq.) or its successor statute shall apply and govern the enforcement of this arbitration clause. By agreeing to arbitration, the parties acknowledge that they have waived the right to a jury trial. further acknowledge and agree that the business realities of television productions of this nature, including the Series, create special circumstances for which Producer must be able to maintain its ability to seek injunctive relief and or other equitable and/or provisional remedies. Accordingly, the parties agree that nothing in this paragraph or in any of the applicable rules of JAMS, shall prevent Producer, SPT or Network from seeking provisional relief outside of arbitration. For example, a participant's premature or threatened disclosure in violation of the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement could result in a reduction of audience interest or other diminution in the value of the Series or Producer's, SPT's or Network's rights hereunder, which would cause Producer, SPT and Network irreparable injury and damage that could not be reasonably calculated or adequately compensated by damages in an action at law I hereby expressly agree that Producer, SPT and Network shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief pursuant to California Code of Procedure section 1281.8 and any successor or similar statute 2.
